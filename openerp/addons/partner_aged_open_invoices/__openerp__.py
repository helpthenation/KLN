Partner Aged Open Invoices
==========================

This module adds a button on the partner form view (the icon on the button is a banknote) to easily open the aged open invoices report of the partner.

It requires the updated version of the module **account_financial_report_webkit** that has the aged open invoice report ; you can find it in this pull request https://github.com/OCA/account-financial-reporting/pull/102

This module has been written by Alexis de Lattre from Akretion <alexis.delattre@akretion.com>.
